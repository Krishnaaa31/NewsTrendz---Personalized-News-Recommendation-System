# NewsTrendz - Personalized News Recommendation System

NewsTrendz is a personalized news recommendation system built using **Streamlit**, **NLP**, and **Machine Learning** techniques. The application analyzes the news reading patterns of a user and recommends similar articles based on their reading history using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.

---

## üöÄ What It Does

* **User Authentication:** Allows users to log in and maintain reading history.
* **News Browsing:** Displays a list of news articles with titles, descriptions, and publication dates.
* **Recommendation System:** Recommends news articles based on user reading patterns using a content-based filtering approach.
* **Evaluation Metrics:** Evaluates recommendations using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1 Score, NDCG, and MAP.
* **Data Processing:** Cleans and preprocesses text data using NLP techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.

---

## üîß Technologies Used

* **Streamlit:** For building the interactive web application.
* **Pandas & NumPy:** Data manipulation and numerical operations.
* **Scikit-Learn:** Machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
* **NLTK:** Text processing (lemmatization, stopword removal).
* **SciPy:** Additional utilities for scientific computing.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Optional visualization (for further analysis or model evaluation).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Data Loading:**

   * The application loads a dataset of news articles from `CNN_Articels_clean.csv`, containing columns such as Headline, Description, Date Published, and URL.

2. **Text Preprocessing:**

   * Text data is preprocessed using techniques like lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal, and lemmatization.

3. **Recommendation System:**

   * The application uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert text into numerical vectors.
   * Cosine similarity is computed to recommend articles similar to the user‚Äôs reading history.

4. **User Session Management:**

   * User session states are managed using Streamlit‚Äôs session state feature, tracking reading history and recommendation preferences.

5. **Evaluation:**

   * Recommendations are evaluated using Precision, Recall, F1 Score, NDCG, and MAP to assess the system‚Äôs performance.

## ‚úÖ Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NewsTrendz.git
cd NewsTrendz
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Download NLTK resources:**

```bash
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('stopwords'); nltk.download('wordnet')"
```

4. **Run the Application:**

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

* **Precision:** Measures the relevance of the recommended articles.
* **Recall:** Measures how many relevant articles are recommended.
* **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.
* **NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain):** Evaluates the ranking quality of the recommended articles.
* **MAP (Mean Average Precision):** Measures the precision of recommendations across multiple queries.

---

## üåê How It Helps

* **Personalized Experience:** Provides relevant news recommendations tailored to user preferences.
* **Data-Driven Insights:** Tracks user behavior and evaluates the effectiveness of recommendations.
* **Scalability:** Can be extended to include additional data sources and recommendation algorithms.
* **Real-Time Recommendations:** Updates recommendations as the user reads more articles.

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

* Implement advanced recommendation algorithms like collaborative filtering.
* Integrate feedback-based learning for better recommendations.
* Enhance the user interface with interactive visualizations.
* Deploy the application using Docker or cloud platforms.
